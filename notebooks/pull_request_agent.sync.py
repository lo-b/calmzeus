## Exploration of simple pull request (PR) agent

### Intro
# How to go from LLM response/answer to a commit (and PR)?
#
# - One way could be to create an agent. It could extract only relevant text in
# an answer and then use this to make the commit for a config task.
# - Another way could be to try playing around with the prompt to get a more
# exact/concise output.
# - Exploring possibility simple (A)ST-based indexing of source files.
# Ensures we keep track of the actual lines in source file of a snippet. Feed
# al this context forward into the LLM. Maybe it can use the additional (e.g.
# line number) context to be more precise in it's output.

### Goal
# Create an agent/chain to extract relevant code/text from LLM answer and
# create a commit.
